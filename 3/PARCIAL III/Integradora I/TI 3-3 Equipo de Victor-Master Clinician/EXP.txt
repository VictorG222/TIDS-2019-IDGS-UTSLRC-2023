Time managment
manage time is not easy and thanks to the development of this project my
knowledge has grown and now I can manage my time in a more efficient way.
Adaptation
There are no skills that can't be learned. We can be pessimistic when it 
comes to carrying out some activities but the skills can be learned. In the 
development and organization of this project served to guide me in which 
aspect I need to reinforce.
Team work
It is not possible for a person to make the project alone either because 
of the time we have or because that person's abilities do not cover many
 fields, so it is important to dialogue and resolve conflicts as soon as 
possible. In this way the result of these could be positive.
Procrastination 
From the beginning of the project I have given priority to this because 
the situation we were in it was not the best. Because of this, I did works 
at the moment so that in the limit time they didn't went wrong.
