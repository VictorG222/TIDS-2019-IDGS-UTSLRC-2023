Now that I have talked a little bit about the background.
If we look at this image we can see the radio frequency spectrum,
and the place were 5g technilogy stands. And it is the safety range.
Because the radio frequencies are not small enoght to affect living
creatures.
All frequencies the are beyond the right direction can really affect
living things.

And do you know what is in that direction. THE SUN
So this is a comparison of how much damage the
sun makes you versus the usage of electronics or
getting an x-ray.


Now let's get to the principal point of the presentation.
Here it is the graph of Google trends  about people
looking the term "5g" in the last 16 years. Here we can see 
clearly were the spike is.
