Good Morning My name is Victor and Today I am going to present about
5g technology and his controversy.
And at the end I am will try to find the meaning of this ideas that
people have about 5g.

First of all if you have not seen a 5g antenna. Well this is how it
looks like. It is diferent because it does not have this round shape
that everyone thinks. This antenna has smaller an rectangular modules
that send information to speciffic directions. 
Not like regular antennas that spread signals to everywhere.

The proyect of the 5g technolog y started in 2008 in south-Korea.
At this date was the first sparkle of 5g.

But it was until 2013 when samsung development the first 5g antenna.
And the principal purpose of the 5g technology was not the mobile 
industry if not IOT.
